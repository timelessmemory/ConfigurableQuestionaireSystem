# Custom Questionaire System
The system is configurable, flexible, including frontend and backend. Backend can configure questionaire information and questions. There are three roles in the backend which includes super administrator, brand administrator, common operator. Following I will introduct their own permission. The frontend show the questionaire you configured and i18n is supported. After user answered questionaire, administrator can download answer in the backend. Technology mainly includes angularjs, jquery, bootstrap, mysql and php. In addition, ueditor is used to edit questionaire.

## Introduction
### login page

You can perform questionaitre in backend after sign in, if you can not, you will be redirect into this page to login.You can change language also in this page.

### list page

This page shows all questionaires you have created. For these, you can edit and delete them or view really questionaire page which is generated by one of them. Specially, I provide a copy function that you can copy the link of questionaire page into clipboard. In addtion, you can also go to create page, logout and search questionaires you want by subject name.

### create page

![createwithindex.png](http://7xqayl.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/createwithindex.png)
In this part, you can see subject, description of questionaire. For description and title of question, I use ueditor which is a rich text editor developed by baidu. You can insert word with various format and pictures, videos. To create questions of questionaire, you can create single choice and multiple choice and also you can allow users input by themselves. For each option of questions, you can set whether allow users to go on answering other questions. For multiple choice, you can set skip index for every option. For example, there are two options of one question and if you choose option one, them you wil be arranged to answer the fifth question but if you choose option two then you will redirect to sixth question. For these you can configure flexibly. The number of options is no-limited.

### edit page

![editaddques.png](http://7xqayl.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/editaddques.png)
You can edit information of questionaires you created in this page. The most important function for this part is to edit questions and options of the questionaire. Because you will modify questions and options you have saved or you want to add options for some question or add questions. The logic is a little complex. And plus skip index, it's so terrible. Therefore, I wrote much code in this part.
